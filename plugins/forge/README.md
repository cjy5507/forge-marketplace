# Forge

Forge is a harness-engineering plugin that turns an agent into a phase-gated virtual software company.

## Quick Start

Choose one install shape:

### Global install

Use one shared Forge install on your machine, then point Claude Code or your Codex host at the
generated plugin root.

One-line bootstrap:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjy5507/forge/main/scripts/bootstrap-install.mjs | node --input-type=module - --scope global --force
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cjy5507/forge.git "$HOME/.forge/src/forge"
node "$HOME/.forge/src/forge/scripts/setup-plugin.mjs" --scope global --force
```

This prepares the plugin at `~/.forge/plugins/forge`.

### Project-local install

Install Forge only for the current repository.

One-line bootstrap:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjy5507/forge/main/scripts/bootstrap-install.mjs | node --input-type=module - --scope project --project-root "$PWD" --force
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cjy5507/forge.git .forge/vendor/forge
node .forge/vendor/forge/scripts/setup-plugin.mjs --scope project --project-root "$PWD" --force
```

This prepares the plugin at `./.forge/plugins/forge`.

### Copy mode instead of symlink mode

The setup script uses symlinks by default so updating the cloned Forge repo updates the installed
plugin too. If your environment requires a standalone copy, add `--mode copy`.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjy5507/forge/main/scripts/bootstrap-install.mjs | node --input-type=module - --scope global --mode copy --force
```

```bash
node "$HOME/.forge/src/forge/scripts/setup-plugin.mjs" --scope global --mode copy --force
```

The bootstrap installer clones Forge into a reusable checkout first, then runs
`scripts/setup-plugin.mjs` for the selected scope.

## What Forge does

- Routes work through build or repair mode
- Persists `.forge/` state across sessions
- Tracks active subagents and recent failures
- Guards code-writing when design prerequisites are missing
- Adapts automatically across light, medium, and full intervention tiers
- Uses role prompts for CEO, PM, CTO, QA, Security, and Troubleshooter workflows

## Plugin layout

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: Claude-facing manifest
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`: Codex-facing manifest
- `.mcp.json`: shared MCP connections, including Context7
- `assets/`: marketplace icon, logo, and screenshots
- `hooks/hooks.json`: lifecycle guardrails
- `skills/`: phase and control skills
- `agents/`: specialist role prompts
- `templates/`: project outputs and evaluation templates

## Installation

Forge is distributed as a single plugin package.

The plugin root is this repository root, not `.claude-plugin/` or `.codex-plugin/` by themselves.
Your plugin host should be pointed at the folder that contains:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- `hooks/`
- `scripts/`
- `skills/`

### Get the plugin files

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cjy5507/forge.git
cd forge
```

Or download the repository as a ZIP from GitHub and extract it.

After that, use the extracted `forge/` folder as the plugin root in your client.

To create a reusable install target automatically, run `scripts/setup-plugin.mjs` with either
`--scope global` or `--scope project`.

### Claude Code

Forge supports two installation paths in Claude Code.

If Forge is published through a Claude Code marketplace, install it with the normal marketplace
flow.

Typical flow:

```text
/plugin marketplace add <owner>/<marketplace-repo>
/plugin install forge@<marketplace-name>
```

If you distribute Forge directly from GitHub, import or install the repository root folder
that contains `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

Do not point Claude Code at `.claude-plugin/` alone. The hooks, skills, agents, templates,
and assets live alongside it in the plugin root.

### Codex

Forge ships with a `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifest.

Install it through your Codex host's plugin or import flow by pointing the host at the same
repository root folder that contains `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.

Do not point Codex at `.codex-plugin/` alone. The manifest expects the rest of the plugin
files to be available through relative paths from the plugin root.

If you publish Forge through a marketplace, the marketplace entry should package the repository
root as one plugin so those relative paths stay intact.

Because plugin hosts vary, Forge intentionally does not assume a fixed global install path or
repo-local marketplace file.

### Local validation after install

Use prompts such as:

- `Build a forge harness for this project`
- `forge status`
- `forge resume`

## MCP note

Forge ships with Context7 configured in `.mcp.json`.

- Default URL: `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp`
- If your client requires auth, add `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` or switch to the OAuth endpoint supported by your MCP client.

## Suggested prompts

- `Build a harness for this repo with Forge`
- `Use forge to diagnose and fix this project`
- `forge status`
- `forge stats`
- `forge resume`
- `Run a Forge A/B evaluation for this task`

## Validation

Run the Forge hook smoke tests:

```bash
npx --yes vitest run scripts/*.test.mts
```

Render marketplace screenshots:

```bash
node scripts/render-marketplace-assets.mjs
```
